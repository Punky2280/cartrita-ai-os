# Vendor Research Summary

| Vendor | Focus | Key Strengths | Differentiators | Noted Limitations |
|--------|-------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| OpenAI | General / Reasoning | Broad model ecosystem, reasoning depth | MCP integration maturity | Cost volatility |
| Anthropic | Constitutional AI | Safety alignment, long context | Policy-driven guardrails | Fewer multimodal endpoints |
| HuggingFace | Open ecosystem | Model diversity, community pace | Inference Endpoints + Spaces | Variable quality across models |
| Deepgram | Speech | Low-latency streaming, accuracy | Real-time TTS + diarization | Narrow domain outside audio |
| Tavily | Search/RAG | Structured search synthesis | High-signal web extraction | Younger ecosystem |
| GitHub | Code intelligence | Code graph + provenance | Native dev workflow embedding | Non-code domain limitations |

\n## Notes\n\n- Strength synthesis derived from individual research reports.\n- Use hybrid vendor strategy: foundational reasoning + specialized vertical (audio/search) to minimize latency & cost.
