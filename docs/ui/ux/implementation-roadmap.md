## ðŸ“‹ Technical Implementation Checklist

### Core Infrastructure

#### State Management Migration
- [ ] Migrate from basic Jotai atoms to v2 architecture
- [ ] Implement proper state persistence and hydration
- [ ] Add state synchronization between tabs/windows

```typescript
// Enhanced state structure for v2
const conversationAtom = atom({
  id: '',
  title: '',
  messages: [] as Message[],
  participants: [] as Participant[],
  context: {} as ConversationContext,
  settings: {} as ConversationSettings,
});

const agentOrchestrationAtom = atom({
  selectedAgents: [] as string[],
  activeWorkflow: null as Workflow | null,
  agentStates: {} as Record<string, AgentState>,
});
```

#### API Integration Enhancement
- [ ] Implement improved error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Add request/response caching and optimization
- [ ] Implement real-time updates with WebSocket/SSE

```typescript
// Enhanced API client for v2
export const apiClient = {
  conversations: {
    list: () => queryClient.fetchQuery(['conversations'], fetchConversations),
    create: (data: CreateConversationData) =>
      queryClient.useMutation(['conversations', 'create'], createConversation),
    stream: (id: string, message: string) =>
      streamMessage(id, message),
  },
  agents: {
    list: () => queryClient.fetchQuery(['agents'], fetchAgents),
    execute: (agentId: string, task: Task) =>
      queryClient.useMutation(['agents', 'execute'], executeAgentTask),
  },
};
```

### Component Migration Strategy

#### Parallel Development Approach
1. **Keep v1 components functional** while building v2 alongside
2. **Use feature flags** to gradually introduce v2 components
3. **Implement progressive migration** starting with least critical components

```typescript
// Feature flag implementation
const useFeatureFlag = (flag: string) => {
  const flags = useAtomValue(featureFlagsAtom);
  return flags[flag] || false;
};

const ChatInterface = () => {
  const useV2Interface = useFeatureFlag('chat-interface-v2');

  return useV2Interface ? <ChatInterfaceV2 /> : <ChatInterfaceV1 />;
};
```

#### Component Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage for all v2 components
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and workflows
- [ ] **Visual Regression**: Automated screenshot comparison
- [ ] **Accessibility Tests**: Automated a11y testing

```typescript
// Example component test
describe('MessageBubble v2', () => {
  it('renders user messages with correct styling', () => {
    render(<MessageBubble variant="user" content="Test message" />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Test message')).toHaveClass('user-bubble');
  });

  it('handles streaming updates correctly', async () => {
    const { rerender } = render(
      <MessageBubble variant="assistant" content="" isStreaming />
    );

    rerender(<MessageBubble variant="assistant" content="Hello" isStreaming />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Hello')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
