# Memory Agent with MCP Protocol Integration

## 🎯 Overview

The Memory Agent provides persistent memory across conversations using a knowledge graph approach, integrated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool management.

## 🚀 Features

- **Knowledge Graph Memory**: Store entities, relationships, and observations
- **MCP Protocol Integration**: Full Model Context Protocol 2025.01 compliance
- **Command Interface**: Easy-to-use `/memo` commands
- **Hierarchical Tool Management**: 5-level safety and hierarchy system
- **Real-time Operations**: Create, search, update, and delete memory entities
- **Relationship Mapping**: Connect entities with typed relationships

## 📋 Available Commands

### Core Commands
- `/memo help` - Show command help
- `/memo create name:type:observation` - Create new entity
- `/memo search query` - Search entities by content
- `/memo get entity_name` - Get detailed entity information
- `/memo list` - List all entities in memory
- `/memo delete entity_name` - Delete entity from memory
- `/memo relate from:to:relation_type` - Create relationship

### Examples
```
/memo create Alice:person:Lead software engineer specializing in AI
/memo create Python:skill:Programming language for AI development
/memo relate Alice:Python:expert_in
/memo search engineer
/memo get Alice
```

## 🛠 MCP Tools Registered

The Memory Agent registers 7 specialized MCP tools:

1. **create_entity** (Level 2) - Create new memory entities
2. **add_observation** (Level 2) - Add observations to existing entities
3. **create_relation** (Level 2) - Create relationships between entities
4. **search_entities** (Level 1) - Search memory by content
5. **get_entity** (Level 1) - Retrieve entity details
6. **list_entities** (Level 1) - List all entities
7. **delete_entity** (Level 3) - Remove entities from memory

## 🏗 Architecture

### Memory Storage
- **Entities**: Objects with name, type, observations, and metadata
- **Relations**: Typed connections between entities
- **Observations**: Discrete facts about entities

### MCP Integration
- Protocol Version: 2025.01
- Hierarchical tool management (Levels 1-5)
- Safety levels for secure operations
- Execution timeout controls

## 🔧 Integration

The Memory Agent is integrated into the main Cartrita Orchestrator:

1. **Command Detection**: `/memo` commands are automatically routed to the Memory Agent
2. **MCP Protocol**: Full Model Context Protocol compliance
3. **Fallback System**: 4-level fallback for reliability
4. **Secure Operations**: API key management and safe execution

## 🧪 Testing

Run the included test files:

```bash
# Core functionality test
python test_memory_simple.py

# Interactive demo
python demo_memory_agent.py
```

## 📊 Memory Structure

### Entity Types
- **person**: People and individuals
- **skill**: Technical skills and capabilities
- **project**: Projects and initiatives
- **task**: Specific tasks and activities
- **note**: General notes and observations

### Relation Types
- **expert_in**: Expertise relationship
- **works_on**: Working relationship
- **used_in**: Usage relationship
- **knows**: Knowledge relationship
- **related_to**: General relationship

## 🎉 Success Metrics
