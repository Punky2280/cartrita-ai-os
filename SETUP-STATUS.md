# Cartrita AI OS ‚Äì Setup Status & Development Notes

## üéØ Project Completion Status

### READY FOR PHASE 3 (Stabilization + Capability Restoration Plan Initiated)

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

*This consolidated section replaces earlier duplicated status blocks to reduce noise.*

- **All linting issues resolved** (ESLint: 0 errors/warnings, v8.57.1 for Next.js compatibility)
- **Security scan clean** (Trivy: 0 vulns, Semgrep: 0 issues)
- **Codacy security fixes applied** (hardcoded credentials ‚Üí env vars, CSP unsafe-eval removed)
- **Hash-locked dependencies** (`constraints.txt` generated, Python 3.13)
- **Setuptools pin policy enacted** (`setuptools==80.9.0`)
- **Voice integration Phase 3 runway cleared** (no blocking debt)
- **Documentation & research** updated with 2025 voice patterns

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Runtime Errors (Expected - Backend Not Running)

#### CSP & WebSocket Errors

1. **CSP Font Loading**: `fonts.googleapis.com` blocked (correct CSP behavior)
1. **WebSocket 403 Errors**: `ws://localhost:8000` failed (backend not running)
1. **Service Worker Errors**: Fonts blocked by CSP

**These are NOT defects** ‚Äì they disappear once backend & CSP allowances are configured for required domains.

## üöÄ Quick Start Sequence

### 1. Start Backend Services

```bash
docker compose up -d api-gateway ai-orchestrator redis postgres
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# populate required API keys (OpenAI, Deepgram, Tavily, etc.)
```

### 3. Launch Frontend

```bash
cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

## üìã Phase 3 Voice Integration ‚Äì Execution Backlog

### Voice Integration (Ready)

1. **Upgrade Deepgram SDK** to 2025 Voice Agent API
1. **Implement React Voice Hooks** (record, downlink, duplex)
1. **Setup WebSocket Infrastructure** (SSE primary, WS duplex fallback)
1. **Deploy Voice Service Layer** (<300ms first audio target)

### Technical Debt (Non-blocking)

- 43 TypeScript errors (tests only)
- Minor CSP policy tuning
- SSE latency harness pending

### Architecture Strengths

- Modular orchestrator & gateway separation
- Structured logging + OTel ready
- Secure CSP / CORS posture
- Deterministic dependency workflow

```

### Additional Voice Integration (Reference Snapshot)

1. **Upgrade Deepgram SDK** to 2025 Voice Agent API
1. **Implement React Voice Hooks** using modern patterns
1. **Setup WebSocket Infrastructure** for real-time streaming
1. **Deploy Voice Service Layer** with sub-300ms latency

### Technical Debt (Non-blocking Reference)

## üéâ Ready For Advanced AI Development

The project is in strong condition for Phase 3 voice integration. Technical debt is minimized, security posture hardened, and the
development path is documented with 2025 best practices.

**Start building immediately** ‚Äì the foundation is solid. üöÄ

## üîÑ Dependency Determinism & Setuptools Warning Resolution

We have migrated to a strict, hash-locked dependency strategy using `pip-tools`.
Flow: `requirements.in` ‚Üí `constraints.txt`.
Earlier a warning indicated `setuptools` was unpinned when using `--require-hashes`.
Decision: **Pin `setuptools==80.9.0` in `requirements.in`** to ensure reproducibility and avoid resolver drift.

Recompile procedure:

```bash
pip install pip==24.3.1 pip-tools==7.4.1
pip-compile --generate-hashes --allow-unsafe --output-file constraints.txt requirements.in
```

Rationale:

- Ensures deterministic Docker builds (no opportunistic upgrade).
- Avoids transient breakages in packaging ecosystem (wheel / build backend changes).
- Keeps hash-based supply chain guarantees intact.
- Pinning an "unsafe" package: `pip-tools` labels `setuptools` (and sometimes `pip`, `wheel`) as *unsafe* because historically they were
	implicitly present and not meant to be locked.
	We deliberately include `--allow-unsafe` so its version and hashes are captured, preventing environment drift and ensuring
	reproducible builds.
	This is a **policy decision** documented in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Setuptools Pin Policy) and should only change via a
	reviewed PR including rollback notes.

Next validation steps (pending tasks):

1. Clean virtualenv hash install verification.
1. Docker image build smoke test (`pip check`, minimal service startup, metrics endpoint probe).
1. GPU variant lock (`requirements-gpu.in` -> `constraints-gpu.txt`).
1. Add nightly drift workflow to surface safe upgradable pins.

## üß™ Full Capability Restoration Plan (Remove Ignores / Harden Quality Gates)

| Phase | Objective | Actions | Exit Criteria |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Baseline Lock Validation | Clean install + Docker build + `pip check` | All deps install cleanly; no hash mismatch |
| 2 | Metrics & Observability Integrity | Validate Prometheus scrape + OTel exporter startup; add smoke test for `/metrics` | 200 OK `/metrics`; OTel spans exported in test env |
| 3 | Lint & Type Strictness Elevation | Inventory TypeScript 43 test errors; categorize (legacy vs fixable), enable incremental `--noImplicitAny` where safe | <10 residual test-only TS errors |
| 4 | Security & SCA Reinforcement | Run Codacy + Trivy (containers) + secret scan; add pre-commit hooks | Zero HIGH vulns; secrets gate active |
| 5 | Streaming & Latency Benchmarks | Add synthetic SSE latency test + p95 tracking histogram | p95 first token < target (<=350ms local) |
| 6 | Agent Reliability & Fallback | Exercise fallback provider chain under induced provider failures | 100% graceful fallbacks (no uncaught exceptions) |
| 7 | Drift & Upgrade Automation | Nightly job opens PR with curated minor updates + diff risk notes | Automated PR for delta changes (green CI) |
| 8 | Documentation & Runbooks | Update ops runbook: dependency regen, rollback, security escalation path | Runbook reviewed & approved |

## üß∞ Codacy & Static Quality Enhancement Methodology

Structured approach to re-enable and tighten all static analysis gates:

1. Inventory current Codacy issue classes (style, complexity, security hints, duplication).
1. Classify issues: (a) True positive requiring fix, (b) False positive (document rationale), (c) Deferred (create ticket with risk note).
1. Apply focused refactors: prefer **localized changes** preserving public APIs.
1. Re-run Codacy CLI per touched file; fail fast on new regressions.
1. Enforce ‚Äúno net new issues‚Äù rule on PRs (quality ratchet).
1. Add badge + trending delta section to status docs.

Metrics to Track:

- Issue density (issues per 1k LOC) trend.
- Cyclomatic complexity outliers (functions > 12).
- Duplication blocks (%) ‚Äì target <3%.
- Security patterns (weak hash, broad except, hard-coded secrets) ‚Äì zero tolerance.

| Performance | p95 first token <350ms; memory stable under concurrency | Unmeasured | Add latency harness + heap snapshots baseline |
| Supply Chain | Hash pinning + vulnerability scan + provenance | Partial | Add `attest`/SLSA-level attestation (future) |
| Testing Strategy | Mix of unit + contract + chaos + perf smoke | Partial | Add streaming contract tests + metrics exporter test |

## üß™ Research Expansion (Planned Evidence Collection)

Upcoming focused research tasks to refine the architecture with citations:

- AI provider fallback resiliency patterns (OpenAI + HF + local models) ‚Äì evaluate adaptive gating.
- Advanced RAG scoring pipelines (hybrid lexical + semantic rerank) ‚Äì incorporate evaluation agent metrics.
- Memory snapshot compression strategies to reduce context tokens (summarization + entity store).
- Streaming token sanitization: per-token banned substring filter efficiency trade-offs.

Each research deliverable will include: scope, methodology, comparative matrix, decision log, update diff summary.
